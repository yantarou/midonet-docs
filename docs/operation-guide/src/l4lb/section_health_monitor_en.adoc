= Health monitor

Health monitoring is the act of checking a set of pool members for "aliveness".
This usually means HTTP, TCP, UDP, or ICMP connectivity is possible to the node.

In MidoNet's case, only TCP connectivity is checked. Health monitors work by
sending packets to the pool members and checking whether or not they receive a
reply. The node is considered ACTIVE if the pool member responds to the packet
within a certain amount of time, and after a certain amount of retries.
Therefore, health monitors act on the following three variables:

* max_retries: How many times the health monitor sends a packet to the pool
member without receiving a response before the health monitor considers the node
to be INACTIVE

* delay: Amount of time between each transmission of a packet from the health
monitor to the pool member

* timeout: Additional timeout after a connection has been established

The health monitor keeps track of the current state of all pool members it is
assigned to. Load balancing decisions can then be made based on the "aliveness"
of a pool member.

== HAProxy configuration

When using a Layer 4 load balancer, you can configure a health monitor to
perform checks on the back-end servers.

Only a single host runs all health monitor instances at a given time. If that
host goes down for any reason, a new host will come up and spawn the necessary
HAProxy instances. The HAProxy instances are managed by the MidoNet Agent
(midolman) and do not require setup. However, you need to choose hosts that can
potentially hold the HAProxy instances.

To configure this, add an haproxy_health_monitor section to the agent section
in mn-conf(1) for the desired hosts, and set health_monitor_enable to true, as
shown in the example below.

[source]
----
agent.haproxy_health_monitor.health_monitor_enable = true
----

Additionally, the hosts running the HAProxy instances must have a group called
"nogroup" and a user called "nobody", otherwise HAProxy will not be able to
start. While this is a default configuration on Ubuntu, on Red Hat you must
create this user and group.

*How the Health Monitor works in the MidoNet Agent*

* The MidoNet Agent (midolman) does not implement its own health monitor.
Instead, it leverages the health checker that is a part of the haproxy package
(the haproxy version used is 1.4). The MidoNet Agent leverages HAProxy by doing
the following:

** Whenever a user attaches a health monitor to a pool, the MidoNet Agent starts
up an HAProxy instance associated with that pool.

** The HAProxy process then receives information about all of the pool members
it must watch.

** The MidoNet Agent periodically polls HAProxy about the status of its nodes.
If it detects a change in status, the MidoNet Agent will update its own database
with the status information.

* The following configuration settings (inside +mn-conf(1)+) tell the
MidoNet Agent how to act with respect to health monitoring:

** health_monitor_enable: true indicates the MidoNet Agent host is eligible to
set up HAProxy for health monitoring. By default, this is set to false.

** namespace_cleanup: true indicates the MidoNet Agent host needs to clean up
any left over HAProxy namespaces on the host that are still present after the
MidoNet Agent has gone down and is no longer the designated HAProxy host. By
default, this is set to false.

** namespace_suffix: String appended to the end of the namespace names that hold
the HAProxy instances. This is to allow you to easily identify the namespaces
being created for HAProxy. _MN is the default value.

** haproxy_file_loc: identifies the location in the file system where the config
files for HAProxy will be created. The default value is: /etc/midolman/l4lb/.

* At any given time, there is only one host containing all of the HAProxy
instances. This host will be one of the MidoNet Agent hosts that has
health_monitor_enable=true defined in its configuration. If this host goes
down for any reason, one of the other hosts with the health_monitor_enable=true
setting will take over and spawn any required HAProxy instances.

== Enabling Health Monitoring in a Pool

To enable health monitoring on a pool you can do perform one of the following:

* Create a health monitor object using the CLI or API server, and set the
relevant delay, timeout, and max_retries values (see "Health Monitor" for
information).

* Attach the health monitor object to the pool that you want to be monitored. A
single health monitor can be attached to any number of pools, but pools may only
have a single health monitor.

* Set the admin_state_up on the health monitor object to true.

*CLI Example*

The example below shows how to use the MidoNet CLI to configure health monitoring.

[source]
midonet> health-monitor list
midonet> health-monitor create type TCP delay 100 max-retries 50 timeout 500
hm0
midonet> load-balancer lb0 pool pool0 set health-monitor hm0
midonet> load-balancer lb0 pool pool0 health-monitor show
hm hm0 delay 100 timeout 500 max-retries 50 state down
midonet> health-monitor hm0 pool list
pool pool0 load-balancer lb0 health-monitor hm0 lb-method ROUND_ROBIN state up

== Disabling Health Monitoring

To disable health monitoring on a pool you can do perform one of the following:

* Set the admin_state_up on the health monitor to false. Note that all pools
that are using this health monitor will have health monitoring disabled.

* Set the health_monitor_id on the pool to null.

* Delete the health monitor object.
