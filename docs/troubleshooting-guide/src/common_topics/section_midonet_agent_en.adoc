== Debugging

During troubleshooting periods, you can increase the logging level via the
`/etc/midolman/logback.xml` file.

To do so, change the root loggers level to one of the following values:
DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

[source]
----
<root level=”DEBUG”>
----

This change does not require an Agent restart. The Agent periodically checks the
configuration file for changes and applies the automatically (within 30
seconds).
