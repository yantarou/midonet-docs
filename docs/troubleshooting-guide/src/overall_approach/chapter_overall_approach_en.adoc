= Overall Approach

When troubleshooting a MidoNet environment, there are multiple layers to be
checked:

* Underlay Network
* Overlay Network
* Virtual Network Topology Simulation
* Virtual Network Topology

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Layer                               |Components
|Virtual Network Topology            |Neutron, MidoNet NSDB
|Virtual Network Topology Simulation |MidoNet Agent
|Overlay Network                     |Tunnel, Datapath
|Underlay Network                    |Physical Environment, Operating System
|=======================

To rule out possible issues these layers shall be checked from bottom to top.
