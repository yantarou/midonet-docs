= Topology Simulation

Topology simulation is done by the MidoNet Agent (Midolman), which retrieves the
virtual topology data from the Network State Database (NSDB).

Check the `/var/log/midolman.log` file for errors or warnings.

Ensure that the connection to the NSDB works properly. The NSDB consists of two
components, ZooKeeper and Cassandra.

You can verify network accessibility manually by pinging the NSDB hosts and
telneting to the appropriate service ports.
