. *Create tunnel zone*
+
MidoNet supports the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) and Generic Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) protocols to communicate to other hosts within a tunnel
zone.
+
To use the VXLAN protocol, create the tunnel zone with type 'vxlan':
+
====
[source]
----
midonet> tunnel-zone create name tz type vxlan
tzone0
----
====
+
To use the GRE protocol, create the tunnel zone with type 'gre':
+
====
[source]
----
midonet> tunnel-zone create name tz type gre
tzone0
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure to allow GRE/VXLAN traffic for all hosts that belong to the tunnel
zone. For VXLAN MidoNet uses UDP port 6677 as default.
